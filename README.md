This repo is for a midterm to arguing between Print-Book or E-Book.


## Print-Book better than E-Book
1. Print-Book help children become better readers, but E-Book will make eyes issue for children.
2. Print-Book help you sleep better than E-Book because E_Book have to read through electronic media screen. It is not good for the human brain.
3. No need for Batteries but E-Book need it.

## An Electronic book is better than it's printed version.

1. It is just one device, which gives access to many books.
2. Accessible Everywhere, car, plane, vacation, pool.
3. Easy on the eyes, because of the screen light it is easy to read e-book at night and in poor lighting.
